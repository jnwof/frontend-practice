# Inventory Management Form (In-progress)
## The first static page I have ever made using HTML and CSS! 

I started learning frontend development around June 2024. At the same time, I was a co-op student working as the Undergraduate Recruitment and Outreach Assistant for the Faculty of Mathematics at Waterloo. One component that the the team was responsible for was the open house events, where we would invite guests, usually students and their families, to the university for a visit. 

While helping set up the venues for these events, I found myself moving in and out of our storage room frequently to
pick-up and deliver necessary items. However, there were multiple instances during these efforts where some items could not be found, they were either hidden or lost!

I identified the issue to be the lack of a inventory management system. Up until then, a member of the team was tasked to manually keep track of the inventory. 
All team members were instructed to report any items that they have taken or returned from the storage room each visit directly to this person. 

We can already tell that this would be ineffective and suceptible to human error and this was true! There were many instances where we expected an item to be 
in-stock because the manual tracking log said so, but it wasn't there! 

Motivated to fix this problem, I wanted to create an inventory management website for the team to use, and this is still currently in development. 
I am still very inexperienced in frontend development let alone full stack, which would be necessary for developing a functional product. However, 
it is my hope that in a couple of weeks, or perhaps months, I will be able to release a prototype for the team to test out. 

The creation of this form is the first step.
