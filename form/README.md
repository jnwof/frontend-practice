# Inventory Management Form (Beta)
## The first static page I have ever made using HTML and CSS! 

I started learning frontend development around June 2024. At the same itme, I was working as the Undergraduate Recruitment and Outreach Assistant 
for the Faculty of Mathematics at Waterloo. One component that the the team was responsible for was the open house events, where we would invite 
guests, usually students and their families, to the university for a visit. 

While helping set up the venues for these events, I found myself moving in and out of our storage room located on the second floor of MC to pick up and
deliver the necessary items. However, there were many times during these efforts, where some items could not be found, or they were no stocks of it remaining. 
I identified the issue to be the lack of a inventory management system. Up till then, another member of the team was tasked to keep track of the inventory, and 
all team members were to report items that they have taken or returned from the storage room each visit. 

We can already tell that this would be ineffective and suceptible to human error, and this was true! There were many instances where we expected an item to be 
in-stock, because the manual tracking log said so, but it wasn't there! 

Motivated by this issue, I wanted to create an inventory management website for the team to use, and this is still currently in development. 
I am still very inexperienced in frontend development let alone full stack, which would be necessary for developing a functional product. However, 
it is my hope that in a couple of weeks, or perhaps months, I will be able to release a prototype for the team to test out. 

The creation of this form is the first step.
